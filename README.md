# SAM Cloud Clusters

A series of scripts used to post-process cloud clusters based on the 3-dimensional thermodynamic field produced by SA.

## Planned updates
    - [ ] Modular calculations
        - [ ] Incorporate modified scipy scripts for periodic boundary condition
        - [ ] Output clusters to Parquet for future mapping
    - [ ] Quick temporal tracking using kernel maps
